3D-printed hose-to-hood coupler and washer for Leah's PAPR

[PAPR info](https://www.sewcialdistancing.org/papr)

Assembly:
+ The coupler is inserted from inside of the hood
+ The coupler orientation is such that the smaller projection goes through the hood material, and the longer projection stays in the hood
+ Glue is applied to the flange where it mates with the material on the inside of the hood
+ The washer is glued to the outside of the hood
+ The washer orientation is such that the inside chamfer mates with the outside of the hood fabric
+ The washer is intended to fit tightly, held on by friction.   The chamfer helps mate it to the coupler.
+ Optionally apply pressure using the specially designed clamp
