Mold-making Components for Prusa Shields

These come from John Broshears in the Kitsap COVID group.

What is in here:
* file1 - is the overall layout of the shell (file2), inner pieces (file3), and 2 Prusa frames that you have to print and cleanup.
* file2 - this is the outer wall of the mold. Too large for many printers. Could be vertically sliced and glued afterwards.
* file3 - the half-moon pieces that serve as the inside of the mold for each frame.
