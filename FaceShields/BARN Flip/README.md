Flip version of Kitsap "hybrid" Prusa-style face shield (which was derived from DtM v4, which was derived from Prusa).

This is a beta version and includes a blank field on the headband which can be personalized with name, logo, etc.

Fusion 360 models are included.

To assemble, snap the Flip Component onto the Headband Component.     Add the 3-hole US version of the shield and the optional chin rest.   Both of the latter can be found in the FaceShields/Prusa directory.
