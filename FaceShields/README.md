# Face Shields

Files related to creating face shields. There may be cloned model files (STL) as well as build plates with settings that 
we've developed for use internally. Both 3D printed parts for the frames and templates for the shields. Also tools and jigs
to assist construction.

## What Face Shields are in here

* Prusa 
* Verkstan 
  * Main Page [3D Printed Protective Visor](https://3dverkstan.se/protective-visor/) 
  * source of STL models [Venkrat Github Models](https://github.com/Cederb/Faceshield.nu/tree/master/North%20America/3D%20Printing%20Files%20(STL))
* Stratasys (NIH)

## Project Goals
1. Provide face shields to local first responders.
3. Coordinate interaction with local first reponders in need to understand their needs and which face shield designs they will accept and which they prefer.
2. Provide a way for individuals with 3D printers to contribute by printing parts (and assembling face shields?).  
3. Coordinate interaction with local first reponders in need to understand their needs and which face shield designs

* 4/5 - Doug has been meeting with members of Bainbridge Prepares (link needed here). Mostly, they have been telling him they are finding commercial sources, but recently have been considering locally made devices. Doug is meeting with them to shown them samples of various designs and find out which they prefer (and which they reject).
