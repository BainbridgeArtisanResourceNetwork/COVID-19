STL and SVG for Stratasys face shield

NIH source here: https://3dprint.nih.gov/discover/3dpx-013421

Note that as of 4/3/2020, the NIH STL (visor) and DXF (shield) designs are not compatible with one another.

Stratasys original: https://go.stratasys.com/lp-face-shield.html

The file Visor No Logo.stl is generated from the original model and should match the DXF/SVG for the shield.
