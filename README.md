# COVID-19
A place where BARN COVID 19 activities are summarized. 

This repository is intended to summarize the actions that BARN members are taking to aid in the response to the COVID19 crisis and help people find specific places they can contribute.

How this resource is organized:
* Each activity has it's own directory.
* Each directory has a "readme" file that summarizes what is happening, what needs to be done, how to contact someone to help.
* Additional pointers to resources.

Members of ETA-Studios Team COVID19-Committers have Write access. All others please fork/branch and open a Pull Request back to 'master' when you're done.
