Replacement face shield project files for CAPR used by local Virginia Mason clinic.

This directory include the original installation manual and templates for both the shield and the "ears" glued to the shield.

It appears that the ears are only for reinforcement.    VM will test to see if they are required.

Shields currently being cut from 11x17" 10 mils thick PVC sheets on CNC-driven drag knife.    Ears cut from 7 mils PET sheets on laser.
